{"main-text":"Message #1\nFrom:  John\n\nHello again, Conrad.\nYour first mission is to reach the infirmary on Level 2. Mandragore agents left a radar scrambler there. It will allow us to escape without being detected by the prison security system. The device is hidden inside a \"MEDIKIT\". I'll be in touch.\nEnd of message."}
